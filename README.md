# Chaos Game Representation of DNA and Proteins

## 📖 **Overview**
This project implements a Chaos Game Representation (CGR) tool for DNA and protein sequence visualization. CGR is a fractal-based method that converts biological sequences into graphical patterns, enabling the analysis of sequence motifs, structure, and composition.

The tool is a web-based application developed using the Flask framework. It allows users to upload biological sequence files in FASTA format and generate CGR plots for both DNA and protein sequences.

## ✨ **Features**
- Upload DNA or protein sequence files in FASTA format.
- Generate CGR plots for DNA using a square-based mapping of nucleotides.
- Generate CGR plots for proteins using a dodecahedron-based mapping of amino acids.
